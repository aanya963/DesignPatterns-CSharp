1️⃣ Why Builder Exists 
The Real Problems:
❌ Problem 1: Telescoping Constructor   

// public class House
// {
//     public House(string foundation) { }
//     public House(string foundation, string walls) { }
//     public House(string foundation, string walls, string roof) { }
//     public House(string foundation, string walls, string roof, string garage) { }
// } 

Now imagine 10 optional parameters.
You end up with:
- 2^n constructors
- Ugly constructor calls
- Hard to read code
- Error-prone


❌ Problem 2: Complex Object Construction
- Sometimes object creation:
- Must follow specific steps
- Must enforce order
- Has optional parts
- Has different representations

DEFINITION:
Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation 
so that the same construction process can create different representations.



9️⃣ When To Use Builder

Use Builder when:

✔ Object has many optional parameters
✔ Object construction is complex
✔ Want readable object creation
✔ Need immutable objects
✔ Need different representations
